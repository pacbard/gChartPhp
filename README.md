> Google Image Charts API is **deprecated in 2012** and was **turned off on March 18, 2019**. This fork use [Image-Charts.com](https://www.image-charts.com) API instead.


PHP Object wrapper for the ~Google Chart~ [Image-Charts](https://www.image-charts.com) API
===========================================

A simple PHP Object wrapper for the [Image-Charts API](https://www.image-charts.com) (a drop-in-replacement and backward compatible chart API with [Google Image-Charts](http://code.google.com/apis/chart/image_charts.html)). Should help anyone who needs to automate the building of the Chart url. Supports (almost) all types of charts.

Prerequisites
-------------
To use this API, you should have a little PHP experience; a little patience to read the documentation; and a little persistence to keep trying if your first charts don't look as you expect them to.

Project migration
-----------------
This project was migrated from a Google Code project.
This project will continue to be mirrored on its <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gchartphp/">Google Code page</a>.

Use the master branch for stable release, the experimental branch for the development release, and the legacy branch for the old release of the wrapper (this branch will not be actively updated).

Pie Chart Example
-----------------
<img src="https://image-charts.com/chart?cht=p&chs=350x200&chd=t:112,315,66,40&chdl=first|second|third|fourth&chco=ff3344,11ff11,22aacc,3333aa&chl=first|second|third|fourth&chof=.png"/>

Pie chart using the gPieChart class generated by this code:

     $piChart = new gPieChart();
     // or if you installed via composer
     // $piChart = new gchart\gPieChart();

     $piChart->addDataSet(array(112,315,66,40));
     $piChart->setLabels(array("first", "second", "third","fourth"));
     $piChart->setLegend(array("first", "second", "third","fourth"));
     $piChart->setColors(array("ff3344", "11ff11", "22aacc", "3333aa"));
     echo $piChart->getImgCode();


Installation via Composer
-----
To install using the Composer framework, first install Composer:

     curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php


Create a composer.json file in your project root:

     {
          "require": {
               "gchartphp/gchartphp": "dev-master"
          }
     }

Then run the install:

     php composer.phar install

Then add this line to your applicationâ€™s index.php file:

     <?php
     require 'vendor/autoload.php';

Notes
-----
 * The version that was first committed to GITHub is the same that the one on Google Code. Future commits will be reserved to GITHub.
 * I am pleased with how the code is shaping up. I haven't had much of an opportunity in the past to play with inheritence and polymorphism in PHP.
